# CSE_216_Project_Booking.com

The project was part of CSE 216 Database Sessional. We chose to build a database on hotels and car rentals.

Database: PostgreSQL in backend. <br>
GUI: JavaFx in frontend. <br>
JDBC driver: link between Java and PostgreSQL. <br>

After sigining in, the user can search for hotels or car rental services.

After searching, a list of hotels are shown. If the user selects a hotel, the available rooms in that hotel will be shown.

After staying in the hotel, the user will be able to give a review.
